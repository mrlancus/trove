# NOTES: status and next steps

_Last updated by a cloud session (Linux, no Xcode). The user has only an Intel Mac, so there is no local Xcode._

## Status
| Part | State | Tested |
|---|---|---|
| `server/` relay (Worker + Durable Object + R2, WebDAV, email-in, AI proxy, price watches, publish-to-link, serves the web app) | ✅ Done | 35 tests on the Workers runtime (incl. a real MIME email) |
| `Packages/TroveCore` (sync, crypto, merge, importers, search, library, price watches, publishing) | ✅ Done | 49 tests, plus an end-to-end test against `wrangler dev` |
| Crypto/sync compatibility Swift ⇄ Worker ⇄ extension ⇄ web app | ✅ Verified both directions | fixtures + scripts |
| `extensions/browser` (Chrome; Safari via app target) | ✅ Done | crypto test + real-Chromium e2e (save, offline queue) |
| `web/` web app (any browser, served by the relay): create vault, recovery, add devices, inbox import | ✅ Done | 11 unit/interop tests; 6 e2e (relay + real Chromium), passing locally and against production |
| `App/` (macOS + iOS/iPadOS app, share ext, widgets, Safari ext) | 🟢 **Builds** on GitHub Actions (Xcode 26.3) for macOS (universal) and iOS; not yet run on a device | CI: `.github/workflows/apps.yml`; downloads at the `latest` release |
| **Clipboard history** (Mac ⌥Space palette, iPhone/iPad screen + Trove keyboard, website view; synced clips, PROTOCOL.md §8) | 🟡 Core + website tested; apps building on CI, not yet run on a device | 6 Swift + 2 JS unit tests, interop fixture, Chromium e2e |
| Relay + web app deployed to Cloudflare | ✅ **https://trove-relay.lancus.workers.dev** | web e2e, Chromium UI e2e and the Swift integration test all pass against production |

**Design mockups:** three directions (A Glass, B Editorial, C Midnight; Mac + iPhone each) in a
private artifact: https://claude.ai/artifact/A9P4DTybx1EaSzG3TcayJg. Ask the user which one to build
before restyling `App/Sources/Views`. The web app currently uses a neutral style close to Midnight.

## The user's setup (important)
- **No Apple Silicon Mac.** The user's Mac is Intel, and current Xcode needs M1 or later. So:
  - **The website is the main client for now:** https://trove-relay.lancus.workers.dev. It can create the vault, sync, import the inbox and add devices.
  - **The Apple apps are built on GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/apps.yml`, Xcode 26.3 on `macos-15`; the repo is public, so it's free). Compile errors are fixed from cloud sessions:
    1. `git fetch origin ci-logs` then `git show origin/ci-logs:macos-errors.txt` (and `ios-errors.txt`, the full `*.log`, `RESULT`).
    2. Run status: `gh api repos/mrlancus/trove/actions/runs`.
  - **Installing:** the run's artifacts are `Trove-macOS` (universal, ad-hoc signed) and `Trove-iOS` (`Trove.ipa`, unsigned). The user installs the IPA with **Sideloadly** using their free Apple ID; that needs redoing every 7 days.
- **The relay is deployed** with `ALLOW_NEW_VAULTS=true`. The user needs that to create the vault on the website. **After they've made their vault, set it to `"false"` and redeploy.** The token for `wrangler deploy` is in the cloud environment (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).

## Next steps
1. **The apps compile** (done in 3 CI rounds). Downloads: https://github.com/mrlancus/trove/releases/tag/latest (`Trove.ipa`, `Trove-macOS.zip`). Next: the user runs them, and we fix what breaks at runtime from their screenshots and descriptions.
   - CI builds without signing, so entitlements (App Groups) aren't checked there. When sideloaded with a free account, App Groups may not work; `SharedConfig.container` then falls back to a local folder, and the share extension should use the relay path.
   - The Mac build is ad-hoc signed, so the data protection keychain is unavailable; `Keychain` falls back to the login keychain on macOS.
2. **The user tries the website**: create a vault, save the recovery code, add the Chrome extension (Devices & extension → extension code), and set up the iPhone (Safari → the site → Setup code; optionally the share Shortcut). Then close the relay to new vaults.
3. **Sideload on iPhone/iPad** once the IPA builds. Pair the app with a setup code from the website (Devices & extension → paste the recovery code → Make a setup code). Note the web-created vault has no iCloud folder; the app should use the relay.
   - Check: does the app join a relay-only vault cleanly (`VaultStore.join` with no iCloud folder)? Fix if not.
4. **Mac app on the Intel Mac**: unzip, right-click → Open. If macOS is older than 15, lower `deploymentTarget.macOS` in `project.yml`.
5. **Clipboard on real devices:** on the Mac, check ⌥Space opens the palette over other apps, typing searches, ⏎ pastes into the front app after Accessibility is allowed, the watcher records copies (and skips 1Password/Keychain), and images/files paste back. On iPhone, add the Trove keyboard (Allow Full Access) and check clips appear. If App Groups don't work with sideloading, the keyboard shows "Nothing here yet"; then it would need another way to get clips (e.g. Full Access + relay with a read-only clips token, which would need a protocol change).
6. **Then:** price-drop alerts and publish-to-link in the apps (the website doesn't have them yet), the design direction (user hasn't picked yet), and link previews for links saved on the website (needs a relay unfurl endpoint, since browsers can't fetch other sites).
7. **Polish / later:**
   - A TextKit 2 live-styling Markdown editor
   - Move `SyncEngine` snapshot persistence from JSON to SQLite once vaults are big
   - SpeechAnalyzer on OS 26
   - Places map, resurfacing ("on this day")
   - Web app: offline support (service worker), collections editing, a richer editor
   - Notion and Readwise import UI (parsers exist in TroveCore)

## Manual steps for the user
- **Start on the website:** https://trove-relay.lancus.workers.dev → New vault → save the recovery code in a password manager.
- **iPhone/iPad now:** open the site in Safari → Setup code tab, using a code from Devices & extension on the computer. Then Share → Add to Home Screen.
- **Chrome extension:** load `extensions/browser` unpacked (chrome://extensions → Developer mode), then paste the extension code from Devices & extension.
- **The real apps:** download from https://github.com/mrlancus/trove/releases/tag/latest.
  - **iPhone/iPad:** install `Trove.ipa` with Sideloadly (sideloadly.io; works on Intel Macs) using your Apple ID. Then on the device: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → trust it, and turn on Developer Mode if asked. Redo every 7 days.
  - **Mac:** unzip `Trove-macOS.zip` and move Trove to Applications. On first open, macOS blocks it; go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**.
- **Relay:** deployed at https://trove-relay.lancus.workers.dev. Optional extras in `server/README.md`: an Anthropic key for cloud AI (costs money, so it's your call) and email routing (needs a domain).
- **GoodNotes:** Settings → Cloud & Backup → Auto Backup → WebDAV, using the values from Trove Settings (in the app; the website doesn't show WebDAV settings yet).

## How the newer features work (built without a Mac)
- **Price-drop alerts:**
  - The item field `priceWatch` is the source of truth. `PriceWatchSync` (run on every sync by relay devices) creates and removes relay watches to match it.
  - The relay checks schema.org prices every ~12h with a Durable Object alarm and pings live sockets on a drop.
  - Apps show a local notification (no push on a free Apple ID), so alerts appear when a device syncs.
  - Privacy: the relay sees product URLs for tracked items only.
- **Publish to link:**
  - The note is stored on the relay in **plaintext** by the user's choice, at `/p/<vault>/<random slug>`.
  - It's rendered with everything escaped and served with a strict CSP and noindex.
  - Re-publishing updates the page; edits aren't pushed automatically.
- **Web app:**
  - It joins as device kind `web` and keeps only derived, non-extractable keys in IndexedDB (see CLAUDE.md rules and PROTOCOL.md §7).
  - It can browse, search, write notes, add links, upload files, resolve conflicts and toggle collections, and it updates live.
  - It can't read the sealed inbox (no private key); the apps import it.
  - One tab at a time; a second tab takes over.

## Decisions made so far
- **Name:** working name "Trove". Ask the user for the final name and suggest 5.
- **Storage:** iCloud Drive vault with per-device journals is the source of truth. The relay is an optional add-on. CloudKit can come later if the user pays for the developer account.
- **Mac app:** not sandboxed (personal use: iCloud Drive path, AppleScript, Obsidian folder). Extensions are sandboxed.
- **Relay AI model:** `CLAUDE_MODEL` defaults to `claude-opus-5-5`. The user wants costs at pennies, so suggest `claude-haiku-5-5` when deploying.
- **Web app keys:** the web app stores derived keys in the browser. That's the one exception to "secrets only in the Keychain". If the user would rather not, remove the `assets` block from `server/wrangler.jsonc`.
- **Bundle ids:** `com.mrlancus.trove(.share/.widgets/.safari)`. App Group: `group.com.mrlancus.trove`.
